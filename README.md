## RDGEN is a RustDesk client generator to use with your self-hosted rustdesk server.

## The client generator is currently hosted [here](https://rdgen.crayoneater.org). If you would like to host the generator yourself, see [here](setup.md)

## This client generator is currently integrated into my rustdesk [api server](https://github.com/bryangerlach/rustdesk-api-server), which is a fork of [rustdesk-api-server](https://github.com/kingmo888/rustdesk-api-server). If you are running my api server, then you will still need to fork RDGEN and go through the setup process, but you won't need to actually run the rdgen server.
